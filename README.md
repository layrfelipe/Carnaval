# My carnival events manager app for 2023!

Find Rio's carnival street events locations, create custom itineraries for each celebration day and share your real time location with your friends.

## Installation
- On terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/layrfelipe/carnaval.git` for download the code
- At this point, I assume you have Node Package Manager (NPM) installed on your machine
- Enter in the directory (`cd /carnaval)` and type `npm i` to download dependencies
- After that, type `npm start` to init the app

### Run it in dev mode
Open `http://localhost:3000` to acess it on the browser


## A guide for collaborators
### App manifest
My goal is to concentrate and organize data from the Rio de Janeiro street carnival events aiming to expand access to culture and entertainment for population in general, but especially for people who live in remote areas of downtown and need to plan well to enjoy and return home safely

### An important PS
Despite the scratchy React mvp web version, my plan is to distribute the app only for mobile devices with React Native

### My barely organized ideas in Figma
- at frontend, i currently have to create a mobile interface design
- at backend, i currently have to include more methods and attributes in the entities but i think we have enough to kick off the development

### Basic API for testing the backend stack I picked (MongoDB, Express and Node)
